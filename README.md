# CheckersAI
*IN PROGRESS - VERY EARLY ON*
A checkers game made with pygame that uses minimax and expectimax to implement artificial intelligence for the computer player. Minimax is implemented with alpha beta pruning.
Supports solo play vs the AI or two player. Still buggy, need to fix small things and polish.
